# Base URL for the backend API.  Include the /api prefix because the Pyramid
# backend exposes its routes under /api.  During local development you can
# rely on the Vite proxy (default) and leave this commented out.  For
# production or for hitting a remote Railway backend, set it explicitly.

# Example: Railway backend
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/api

# Example: Local backend without proxy
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:6543/api
